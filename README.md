# Extra Terestrial Killer


**NOTE unmaintained**
This project was completed as an assignment for a Telecommunication class. Written in Visual Basic.

The main point is not the graphics nor the gameplay but connecting via bluetooth and using the Wiimote as a cursor/controller.
This could be easily extended to run certain tasks when you push certain WiiMote buttons. Like change the music, open a browser.. etc.

You need a bluetooth transciever if your computer isn't plugged.
Then you need to pair your wiimote from the control panel.

No Linux version available since time was short and all we needed to do was make it work for Windoze.

Completed somewhere around 2012.
